# Criterion Results Cleanup Summary

**Generated:** 2024-12-19

## Space Savings Achieved

- **Before cleanup:** 49M
- **After cleanup:** 7.7M  
- **Space saved:** 41.3M (84% reduction!)

## What Was Removed

The cleanup process removed **Criterion report directories** that contained:

- HTML files for web-based benchmark reports
- SVG plot and visualization files (1,186+ files)
- CSS stylesheets for report formatting
- JavaScript files for interactive charts
- PNG/other image assets
- Static web assets for human-friendly viewing

**Total removed:** 97 report directories containing web visualization files

## What Was Preserved

All **essential benchmark data** remains intact:

### JSON Data Files (1,412 files)
- `estimates.json` - Performance measurements, confidence intervals, statistical analysis
- `sample.json` - Raw timing sample data points
- `benchmark.json` - Benchmark configuration and metadata  
- `tukey.json` - Statistical significance test results
- All metadata files (`system-info.json`, `build-info.json`, `source-hashes.json`, etc.)

### Analysis Files
- Assembly code files (`.s` files)
- SIMD analysis results (`simd-analysis.json`)
- Compilation logs and error reports
- Complete execution logs

### Directory Structure
- Complete run organization by hostname/source-hash/rustc-version
- All baseline comparisons and target-specific results
- Index files for run tracking

## Impact on Analysis

**No impact on downstream analysis capabilities:**
- All numerical benchmark data is preserved
- Statistical analysis data is complete
- Performance comparisons remain possible
- Assembly and SIMD analysis data intact
- System metadata fully preserved

**Benefits:**
- 84% reduction in storage space
- Faster git operations (clone, push, pull)
- Reduced GitHub storage quota usage
- Maintained full analysis capabilities

## Data Integrity

The cleanup process removed only **visualization files** used for human-friendly web reports. All the underlying **numerical data** that drives those visualizations is preserved in JSON format.

If web reports are needed in the future, they can be regenerated from the preserved JSON data using Criterion's tooling.

## Future Prevention

Updated `.gitignore` to automatically exclude report directories from future commits:

```gitignore
# Exclude large Criterion report directories (HTML, SVG, CSS, JS)
/results/runs/*/raw-results/criterion/*/report/
/results/runs/*/raw-results/criterion/*/*/report/
```

The comprehensive benchmarking script (`run_comprehensive_benchmarks.sh`) has been modified to exclude report directories during data collection, preventing this issue in future runs.
